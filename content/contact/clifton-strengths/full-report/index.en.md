**The Gallup Test is a research tool that allows for the assessment of the intensity of 34 character traits in a person. Five of them are the so-called main traits (talents) that dominate in everyday life.**

The premise is that understanding one's innate abilities and developing them will contribute to achieving greater personal and professional successes.

The Gallup Test consists of around 200 questions. Each question is a pair of two statements, e.g., I read instructions carefully or I like to start work immediately. The participant's task is to choose the statement that best describes their behaviour. Depending on the purchased package, the test report describes only the top 5 talents or the intensity of all 34 examined traits.
