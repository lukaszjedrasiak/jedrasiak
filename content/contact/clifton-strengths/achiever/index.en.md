Every new day is like a blank page. To fall asleep peacefully, I need to know that I have managed to achieve something tangible. No matter how much and how intensely I worked â€“ if the effort did not yield any tangible result, I will feel empty inside.

The sense of a job well done, however, is only temporary and lasts at most until the next morning. Fortunately, I have learned to somehow live with the feeling of perpetual dissatisfaction and draw energy from it for work.
