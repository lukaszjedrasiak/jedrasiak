**People who are dominated by the trait of _deliberation_ deeply consider their decisions or choices before making them. They can foresee potential obstacles.**

I believe that the world is unpredictable, and beneath the surface of apparent stability, there is always risk lurking. Instead of denying its existence, I bring it to the forefront – where I identify, assess, and reduce it. I like to plan everything in advance – I even go to the toilet according to a schedule.

I carefully choose my friends and listen more than I speak. I am cautious when giving out rewards and praise. If, due to my restraint, I do not elicit sympathy from certain people – it's their loss.
