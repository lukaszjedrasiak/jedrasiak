**People who are dominated by the trait of _focus_ can set a direction for themselves, follow it, and make adjustments necessary to stay on the chosen course.**

Life and work without a clearly defined direction quickly become frustrating. That's why I regularly set new goals for myself, both professionally and personally. Whether it's short-term or long-term goals, they are always SMART, meaning specific, measurable, and time-bound.

I treat the set goals as a filter. I evaluate each action for its usefulness in achieving the intended result. If a certain activity does not help reach the goal, it means it is not important. And if it is not important, it is not worth my time.
