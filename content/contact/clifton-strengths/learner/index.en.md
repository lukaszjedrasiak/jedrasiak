**People who are dominated by the trait of _learning_ have a strong desire for learning and continuous self-improvement. They are more excited by the learning process itself than its results.**

I love to learn. Not for the sake of becoming an expert in a narrow field (followed by interviews, autographs, and workplace visits) â€“ the process itself, that is, persistent and thoughtful progress from ignorance to competence, energises me. Learning is not about catching the rabbit, but about constantly chasing it.

I feel at home in a dynamically changing work environment, where I must quickly acquire knowledge and skills in an entirely unfamiliar field, only to move on to the next ambitious project soon after.
