1. Solopreneur – employing full-time staff is a considerable responsibility for their development and mortgage repayments. I don't want to take it on now, and the available budget does not allow it.
2. Global reach – this high-sounding term means that content will be published only in English.
3. Self-financing – until necessary, I won't use external funding, whether grants or investment funds.
4. Scalability – I won't offer services based on an hourly rate system.
5. AI + no-code / low-code – For a side project to not just become an expensive hobby, the lack of employees and external financing has to be compensated for somehow else; In my case, through no-code / low-code technologies and AI systems.
