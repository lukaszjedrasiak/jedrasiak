Your side project - just like any business or startup - should address a specific problem. Looking around, you'll spot numerous issues that could use a solution. Your resources are limited (time, money, motivation), so you must be selective.

The most crucial criteria when choosing a side project idea are:

1. **The problem you wish to solve is significant to people** – there needs to be a substantial group of individuals willing to spend money on a solution to that particular issue.
2. **The market is under-served** – the existing solutions should be underperforming in addressing the chosen issue.
3. **You are passionate about solving this problem** – the problem should captivate you to the extent that you'd want to spend years searching for its solution.

In upcoming posts, I'll delve deeper into all three points. Finding a topic that genuinely engrossed me was the most challenging aspect, so I'll initially focus on point 3.
