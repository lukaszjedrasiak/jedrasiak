**When building a side project outside of work hours, fatigue will set in sooner or later, possibly accompanied by the urge to abandon your plans. Working on a project you're passionate about will push back this point - possibly forever.**

I spent a long time trying to find out what I loved doing. During that time, I tried out many jobs. I worked in hotels, helped with European funds, did advertising, carpentry, and managed marketing.

Here's a description of the method that helped me to come up with the idea of creating an educational robot.

## listing

List all your past activities, dividing them into the following categories:
- What do you like to do,
- What you know how to do,
- What others are willing to pay for.

List as many of your past activities as possible, including hobbies, volunteer work, student internships, and other non-paid activities.

## filtering

From the list you've prepared, strike out activities based on the following criteria:
- Hard-to-scale actions;
- Activities the world doesn't need or soon won't need.

## visualising

Plot the remaining activities on a Venn diagram of three intersecting circles.

## analysing

Looking at the diagram, try to uncover a theme that intersects all three spheres - this will be the perfect industry for your side project! You can also use the help of AI, using the prompt below for GPT.

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 1rem;">
You're a career advisor. Here are my past activities divided into three groups: what I like to do, what I can do, and what others are willing to pay me for. Suggest five side project ideas (startups built outside of work hours) where I can use the knowledge and skills from as many of the topics provided.

What I like to do:
- DIY (designing new things)
- Electronics
- Programming
What I can do:
- DIY (designing new things)
- Marketing
What others are willing to pay for:

## sharing

Be sure to share the discovered theme of your side project – for example in social media.
