**While building a side project, sooner or later, there will come a moment of fatigue and discouragement. Prepare for it in advance by determining why you want to do it.**
<!--more-->
I'm not starting my own business because I suffer from too much free time. A side project is a tool to achieve my life goals for the following years.

I divided my plans and dreams into six groups, according to the following criteria:
- private vs professional,
- operational (to be realised this year), tactical (2-3 years perspective) and strategic (4-5y).

You can find an example matrix in the table below.

{{<table class="mono">}}
| | private | professional |
| --- | --- | --- |
| operational (1 y) | complete the education path in front-end development and JavaScript | build my web application using a no-code platform |
| tactical (2-3 y) | complete the educational path in programming with Python and MicroPython languages | monetise the application and achieve revenue at least equal to full-time job compensation |
| strategic (4-5 y) | pass high school mathematics and start engineering studies in automation and robotics. | build an expert brand in the no-code / low-code area â€“ speak at an international conference |
{{</table>}}

I also treat the list of goals as a filter. My problem is not the lack of life ideas but their abundance. Written down goals help me filter out subsequent "brilliant" ideas that come to mind every day :)
