**A few months ago, I thought no-code and AI would take away my job. However, if you can't beat them, join them.**

Today I work as a no-code/low-code developer, and additionally, I'm starting up a side hustle in this industry. This will be an educational robot with an open architecture (open source / open hardware), along with a platform for its online management.

Why side hustle?
* Personal goal: to earn money for engineering studies in automation and robotics.
* Professional goal: to build an expert personal brand in the no-code / low-code development sector. For this, I need a project where I will have complete freedom of action and about which I can speak publicly, without the risk of revealing clients' secrets.

I'll be describing all my successes and failures, so if you're curious about what running a side business looks like from the inside: click on the "bell" icon on my profile or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

I dedicate this post to Jacek Kłosinski, who said, “Go for it”, after hearing about the preliminary concept of my project.

In the next post, I will write more about setting personal and professional goals.
