**A bistable multivibrator (flip-flop) is an electronic circuit that allows for manual generation of a square wave signal at the output.**
<!--more-->
The bistable flip-flop has 2 outputs. When one has a high state (logical "1"), the other has a low state (logical "0"), and vice versa. The name of the circuit comes from the two stable states ("ones") that appear alternately during its operation.

Admittedly, generating a useful control signal by manually switching the inputs is rather impossible, but analysing the operation of this circuit helped me understand the principle of operation of the astable multivibrator described in a separate article.
